Predicting equipment failures is crucial for industries where unexpected downtime can have significant operational and financial consequences. Traditional methods of failure prediction often rely on analyzing physical signs of wear and tear, which may not be suitable for industries like semiconductor manufacturing where failures can be abrupt and event-based. Moreover, relying solely on temporal data can lead to inaccuracies and overlook significant details about potential malfunctions. To address these drawbacks, there is a growing trend towards incorporating extensive equipment logs, sensor data, and contextual factors such as process parameters and environmental conditions to improve failure prediction accuracy.

## Literature Review

### Need for Equipment Failure Prediction

Predictive maintenance, including failure prediction, aims to forecast equipment failures before they occur. This proactive approach is essential for minimizing downtime and mitigating operational and financial impacts. With advancements in sensor technology and real-time data collection, research in failure prediction has focused on reevaluating temporal inputs. These methods typically involve continuously monitoring equipment conditions and utilizing statistical models or machine learning algorithms to predict failure occurrences based on collected data.

### Traditional vs Modern Methods

Traditional methods of failure prediction primarily focus on modeling the degradation process of equipment and predicting failure based on the state of degradation. While effective for certain types of gradual degradation, these methods may fall short in predicting failures caused by abrupt events or complex interactions within the equipment or operating environment.

## Project Overview

This project aims to develop an equipment failure prediction system that leverages big data analytics and contextual integration to enhance prediction accuracy. By combining extensive equipment logs, sensor data, and contextual factors, the system will provide a more comprehensive understanding of equipment health status. Machine learning algorithms will be utilized to analyze the collected data and predict potential failures before they occur.

## Methodology

The methodology involves the following steps:

1. **Data Collection:** Gather extensive equipment logs, sensor data, process parameters, and environmental conditions.
2. **Data Preprocessing:** Clean and preprocess the collected data to ensure quality and consistency.
3. **Feature Engineering:** Extract relevant features from the data, including temporal, sensor, and contextual features.
4. **Model Development:** Train machine learning models using the processed data to predict equipment failures.
